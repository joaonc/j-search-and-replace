This is yet another little utility that I did for my use and might benefit other people as well.

The objective is simple: search and replace text in files. A new file can be generated or the existing file can be replaced.

You can also re-use the code. Tried to keep it simple and modular. Has some good stuff on updating the registry under UAC.

Also, **make sure you read the wiki** pages!

Any suggestions are welcome. Enjoy!
